This repository will hold some useful scripts for finding potential origins of replication and DnaA boxes for experimental verification.

The find_kmers_with_mismatches_and_reverse_complements script finds the most frequent k-mers counting reverse complements and 
sub-sequences within hamming-distance d in a sequence. It can be run from the command line by specifying option -s, -k, and -d.
